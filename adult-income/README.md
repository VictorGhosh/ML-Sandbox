# Adult income prediction
Predict if someone makes more or less than 50k a year. Random forest and neural network models were implemented but no effort has been put into optimizing either one at this time. Important features can be learned from the forest.

 Data from [rabailanees on Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/endofnight17j03/heart-failure-prediction-dataset/code](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabailanees/adult-income-dataset/data))

 The dataset has no labels so some of the columns were left out as a result.
