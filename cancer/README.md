# Lung Cancer Mortality
 Created to predict lung cancer mortality using a neural network in order to learn about GPU loading with CUDA and PyTorch embedding. Very inaccurate. for now, I am moving on to other things but may come back to this later.

 Data from [masterdatasan on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masterdatasan/lung-cancer-mortality-datasets-v2/code)
